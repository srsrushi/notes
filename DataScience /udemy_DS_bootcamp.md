Factorial means all combinaitons. formula for same is p! = 3! = 3x2x1 = 6
Factorial of 0 is 1
Factorial = Permutation = n!
Variation = n!/(n-p)!
Combination = n!/p!(n-p)!
Varation doesn't consider order but Combinaiton does. Every combinaiton is variation but not every varation.
Permutation formula P!.
Formula to calculate variation with repipation: n!/(n-p)!. n = all values p = posistions to place.
Combination  formula  C=n!/p!(n-p)!
